### 1. Clone or Download the Project
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd placement_tracker
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Supabase Database

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy and paste the contents of `database_schema.sql`
4. Execute the SQL to create tables and policies

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
```

### 6. Update App Configuration

Edit `app.py` and replace the placeholder values:
```python
SUPABASE_URL = "your-supabase-url"
SUPABASE_KEY = "your-supabase-anon-key"
app.secret_key = 'your-secret-key-here'
```

```sql
INSERT INTO admins (email, password_hash) VALUES 
('admin@placement.com', 'pbkdf2:sha256:260000$salt$hash');

Or use Python to generate a proper password hash:
